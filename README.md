# Bugs

A game designed to spark interest in Computer Science for middle/high school students. 
It is a multiplayer game where each player creates a colony of ants, and the player with the most ants at the end wins.
The players program their ants with code that they write in the "Bugs" language, which is somewhat similar to Assembly code.

What I did:

-> I designed the compiler for the ants, which basically means I wrote code that is able to interprete the code written by the user, and use that to manipulate the ants in the game.
-> I created the classes for all objects, of which there are about 10. The object hierarchy displays well thought out inheritance.
